\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}%{{{

During the years, the Syllabus has evolved. Currently it has the following purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
It specifies a small set of required prerequisite knowledge.
Below, this is given in the category ``Included, unlimited''
and to some extent also in ``Included, to be defined''.

\item
It serves as a set of guidelines that help decide whether a task is 
suitable for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
Based on this document, the International Scientific Committee (ISC)
evaluates the task proposals when selecting the competition tasks.

\item
As a consequence of the previous item, another purpose of the Syllabus 
is to help the organizers of national olympiads prepare
their students for the IOI.

\end{itemize}

The Syllabus aims to achieve these goals by providing a classification of topics and 
concepts from mathematics and computer science. 
More precisely, this Syllabus classifies each topic into one of six categories.
Ordered by topic suitability, these are:

\begin{myitemize}
\Iincluded Included, unlimited
\Idefine   Included, to be defined
\Icodeonly Included, not for task description
\Inofocus  Outside of focus
\Iexmaybe  Excluded, but open to discussion
\Iexcluded Explicitly excluded
\end{myitemize}

\noindent
In the next section we explain the scope of each category.

\newpage
%}}}

\section{Categories}\label{sec:categories}%{{{

This Syllabus classifies a selection of topics into six different ca\-tegories. 
Obviously, such a set of topics can never be exhaustive.
Instead, the list given in this Syllabus should serve as examples that map out the boundary.
Topics not explicitly mentioned in the Syllabus should be classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -3pt
\item Anything that is a prerequisite of an Included topic is also Included.
\item Anything that is an extension of an Excluded topic or similar to an Excluded topic is also Excluded.
\item Anything else that is not mentioned in the Syllabus is considered Outside of focus.
\end{itemize}

Note that issues related to the usage of suitable terminology and notations in competition tasks
are beyond the scope of this document.\footnote{See
T. Verhoeff: \emph{Concepts, Terminology, and Notations for IOI Competition Tasks},
\url{http://scienceolympiads.org/ioi/sc/documents/terminology.pdf}}

If there is a particular topic for which you are not sure how it should
be classified, we invite you to submit a clarification request to the 
current Syllabus maintainer.

\bigskip

\noindent
Here are the definitions of the six possible classifications:

\begin{description}
\item[\Cincluded\ Included, unlimited]~\\
    Topics in this category are considered to be prerequisite knowledge.
    Contestants are expected to know them. These topics can appear
    in task descriptions without further clarification.

    Example: \emph{Integer} in~\S\ref{subsubsec:NG}

\item[\Cdefine\ Included, to be defined]~\\
    Contestants should know this topic,
    but when it appears in a task description,
    the statement should contain a sufficient definition.
    This category is usually applied in situations where a general
    concept that would be \Cincluded\ has many different ``flavors'' and a formal definition
    is needed to distinguish among those.

    Example: \emph{Directed graph} in~\S\ref{subsubsec:DS}~DS2

\item[\Ccodeonly\ Included, not for task description]~\\
    Topics that belong to this category should not appear in tasks 
    descriptions. However, developing solutions and understanding 
    model solutions may require the knowledge of these topics.

    Example: \emph{Asymptotic analysis of upper complexity bounds\/}
    in \S\ref{subsubsec:AL}~AL1

    Note: This is the main category that should be of interest when 
    preparing contestants for the IOI. 
    It should be noted that this set of topics
    contains a wide range of difficulties, starting from simple concepts and ending 
    with topics that can appear in problems that aim to distinguish among 
    the gold medallists. It is \textbf{not} expected that all contestants
    should know everything listed in this category.

\item[\Cnofocus\ Outside of focus]~\\
    Any topic that is not explicitly addressed by the Syllabus
    should be considered to belong to this category.

    Contestants are not expected to have knowledge of these topics.
    Most competition tasks will not be related to any topics 
    from this category.

    However, this does not prevent the inclusion of 
    a competition task that is related to a particular topic
    from this category. The ISC may wish to include such a competition 
    task in order to broaden the scope of the IOI.
    
    If such a task is considered for the IOI,
    the ISC will make sure that the task can reasonably be solved
    without prior knowledge of the particular topic, and that 
    the task can be stated
    in terms of \Cincluded\ and \Cdefine\ concepts in a precise, concise, 
    and clear way.

    Examples of such tasks being used at recent IOIs include:
    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -3pt
    \item Languages (a.k.a. Wikipedia) from IOI 2010 in Canada
    \item Odometer (a.k.a. robot with pebbles) from IOI 2012 in Italy
    \item Art class from IOI 2013 in Australia.
    \end{itemize}


\item[\Cexcluded\ Explicitly excluded]~\\
    Some of the harder algorithmic topics are explicitly marked as excluded.
    It is guaranteed that there will not be a competition
    task that \emph{requires} the contestants to know these areas.

    Furthermore, the tasks will be set with the goal that knowledge of 
    Excluded topics should not help in obtaining simpler solutions / solutions 
    worth more points.

    This category contains topics whose inclusion will result in
    problems that are unaccessible to a significant portion of IOI participants.
    This includes but is not limited to hard textbook algorithms and advanced
    areas in mathematics.

    Still, note that the Syllabus must not be interpreted to restrict in 
    any way the techniques that contestants are allowed to apply in solving 
    the competition tasks.
    
    Examples: \emph{Calculus\/} in~\S\ref{subsubsec:other-mathematics}

\item[\Cexmaybe\ Excluded, but open to discussion]~\\
    As the Syllabus is a living document, there can be cases when we consider
    bringing in some of the Excluded topics. Usually, the topics in question
    are natural extensions of Included topics, or ones where drawing an exact
    boundary is difficult. Should such topics appear, they will be temporarily
    classified as ``Excluded, but open to discussion'', and by doing so we encourage 
    all members of the IOI community to give us feedback on these topics.

    \begin{quote}
    We quote from the IEEE-CS Curriculum:

    \sffamily\small
    Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering.
    The real-world performance of any software system depends only on two things:
    (1)~the algorithms chosen and
    (2)~the suitability and efficiency of the various layers of implementation.
    Good algorithm design is therefore crucial for the performance of all software systems.
    Moreover,
    the study of algorithms provides insight into the intrinsic nature of the problem
    as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming language,
    programming paradigm, computer hardware, or any other implementation aspect.

\section {Computer Literacy}%{{{
\label{subsec:computer-literacy}

\begin{quote}
The text of this section is \Ccodeonly.

\medskip

Contestants should know and understand the basic structure and operation of a computer
(CPU, memory, I/O).
They are expected to be able to use a standard computer with graphical user interface,
its operating system with supporting applications,
and the provided program development tools
for the purpose of solving the competition tasks.
In particular,
some skill in file management is helpful (creating folders, copying and moving files).

Details of these facilities will be stated in the \emph{Competition Rules\/}
of the particular IOI.
Typically, some services are available through a standard web browser.
Possibly, some competition-specific tools are made available,
with separate documentation.

It is often the case that a number of equivalent tools are made available.
The contestants are not expected to know all the features of all these tools.
They can make their own choice based on what they find most appropriate.

\medskip

The following topics are all \Cnofocus:
  Calculator,
  Word-processors,
  Spreadsheet applications,
  Database management systems,
  E-mail clients,
  Graphics tools (drawing, painting).
